# 👋 Hi, I'm Fernando

After more than 20 years of experience in the hospitality industry, I made a bold decision to completely change my life and dive into the world of programming.

I'm currently studying at 42, where I'm building a solid foundation in low-level programming: C language, shell scripting, Git, and operating system fundamentals.

## 🎯 Why me?

- 🛫 I emigrated alone at the age of 19, gaining resilience, courage, and a strong work ethic.
- 🌍 I speak several languages and adapt quickly to demanding international environments.
- 🧠 I bring years of real-life experience managing high-pressure situations, teamwork, and customer relations.
- 🔄 I'm not afraid to start over or fail—I'm here to learn and grow every day.

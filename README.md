# Fernando Vilas Paz

After more than 20 years in the hospitality industry, I made a bold decision to completely change my life and dive headfirst into the world of programming. I’m now a full-time student at [42 Málaga](https://42malaga.com), where I’m building solid foundations in low-level programming, cybersecurity, and system administration.

> _"Sometimes you win, other times you learn."_
> I believe in learning by doing — failing fast and improving faster.

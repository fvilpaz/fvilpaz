# 👋 Hi, I'm Fernando

After more than 20 years in the hospitality industry, I made a bold decision to completely change my life and dive headfirst into the world of programming. I’m now a full-time student at [42 Málaga](https://42malaga.com), where I’m building solid foundations in low-level programming, cybersecurity and system administration.

> _"Sometimes you win, other times you learn."_
> I believe in learning by doing — failing fast and improving faster.

## 🎯 Why Me?

- 🛫 Emigrated alone at 19 — resilience, independence, and strong work ethic. 
- 🌍 Multilingual and adaptable to fast-paced, international environments.
- 🧠 Real-world experience managing high-pressure teams and customer-facing situations.
- 🔄 Not afraid to start over — I'm committed to lifelong learning and reinvention.

## 💻 Currently Learning

- C programming (memory management, pointers, Makefiles, system calls)
- Bash scripting and automation
- Git & GitHub workflows
- Linux system administration (UFW, SSH, auditd, cron)
- Cybersecurity basics and system hardening

---

## 🔨 Projects & Challenges

- ✅ **Born2BeRoot** – Hardened Linux VM: auditd, firewall (UFW), secure sudoers.
- ✅ **libft** – C standard library functions built from scratch.
- ✅ **ft_printf** – Custom printf using variadic functions & format parsing.
- ✅ **get_next_line** – Efficient file reader using static buffers.
- 🚧 **so_long** – 2D game: map parsing, enemy movement, flood fill.
- 🚧 **mini_talk** – Client-server communication using UNIX signals.
- 🚧 **push_swap** – Stack-based sorting with optimized instructions.
